Darkness flees the rising sun
The village lies ahead
It will wake to a new day soon
Soon they'll all be dead
We came in cover of moonless night
Fifty men at arms
Now at first morning light
The church bell sounds the alarm
Sacrifice to gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods of war arise
Sacrifice to gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods of war arise
Hear the tortured screams
Shattering the air
They awake from soothing dreams
Into their worst nightmare
Fire sweeps their homes
They feel the dragon's breath
Consuming and destructive flames
Agonizing death
